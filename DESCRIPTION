Title: DecoMetDIA: Deconvolution of Multiplexed MS/MS Spectra for
        Metabolite Identification in SWATH-MS based Untargeted
        Metabolomics

Description: DecoMetDIA picks peaks from SWATH acquired data with XCMS and
     extracts MS2 EICs under related SWATH window for each feature of different
     sample. Deconvolution algorithms are applied to MS2 EICs for each feature
     and thus MS2 spectra are generated. The features are identified by matching
     the obtained spectra with librarial ones.
